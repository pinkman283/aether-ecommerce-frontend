Orders qualifying for promotional free delivery thresholds receive automatic delivery fee waivers at checkout.",
  },
  {
    category: "Shipping & Delivery",
    question: "How do I track my order status in real time?",
    answer: "As soon as your order is dispatched, you will receive an SMS and email notification containing your courier tracking number. You can also visit our Track Order page at any time and enter your order number (e.g. ORD-2026-XXXXX) for live fulfillment updates.",
  },
  {
    category: "Orders & Payments",
    question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    answer: "We support Cash on Delivery (COD) nationwide, alongside instant digital payments via bKash, Nagad, Rocket, and all major debit/credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, AMEX).",

    question: "How do I apply a discount voucher or coupon code?",
    answer: "You can enter your promotional coupon code in your Cart Drawer or directly on the Checkout Summary page. The discount will instantly calculate and subtract from your order total before payment.",
  },
  {
    category: "Authenticity & Products",
    question: "Are your vape devices and e-liquids 100% authentic?",
    answer: "Yes, absolutely. All disposable devices, pod systems, coils, and e-liquids are sourced directly from authorized manufacturers and verified distributors. Most products feature holographic scratch-off security codes that you can authenticate on the manufacturer's official verification portal.",
  },
  {
    category: "Authenticity & Products",
    question: "What is the difference between Salt Nicotine and Freebase e-liquids?",
    answer: "Salt Nicotine e-liquids provide a smoother throat hit at higher nicotine strengths (typically 20mg–50mg) and are designed specifically for low-wattage refillable pod systems. Freebase e-liquids are usually formulated in lower strengths (3mg–12mg) with higher VG ratios, ideal for high-wattage sub-ohm tank setups producing dense clouds.",
  },
  {
    category: "Authenticity & Products",

  {
    category: "Safety & Age Policy",
    question: "What is your age verification policy?",
    answer: "In compliance with strict adult advocacy and consumer safety standards, our products are strictly intended for adult smokers and vapers of legal smoking age (18+). We do not sell to minors under any circumstances, and doorstep identity verification may be requested by delivery agents.",
